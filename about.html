                    Julien Offray de La Mettrie was a French philosopher and physician, notorious for his materialistic and mechanistic philosophy of human nature. Born in 1709 in Saint-Malo, France, he is best known for his work "Man a Machine" (L'Homme Machine) which posits that humans and animals are complex biological machines, governed by the same physical and biological laws.

                    His ideas were controversial, challenging the religious and philosophical norms of the time and led to his exile in Holland, and later to Prussia under the protection of Frederick the Great. La Mettrie's thoughts contributed significantly to the Enlightenment's emphasis on empirical and rational bases for knowledge and have continued relevance in discussions on artificial intelligence and consciousness.
