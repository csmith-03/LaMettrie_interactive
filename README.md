# An Interactive Web-App for Julien Offray de La Mettrie
#### Created for Final Project in History of Modern Philosophy - Spring 2024 with Dr. Boyle at College of Charleston

## About
This web application is an interactive exploration of Julien Offray de La Mettrie's philosophy and its relevance today, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence.
La Mettrie, a French philosopher and physician, proposed the radical idea that humans are complex biological machinesâ€”a view that prefigured modern debates on AI and consciousness.
This app is designed to accompany the written component of my final project, providing users with an engaging way to understand La Mettrie's thoughts and their implications.
